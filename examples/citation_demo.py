Demonstration of the enhanced citation system in GraphRAG.

This example shows how to:
1. Index documents with proper source attribution
2. Query with detailed citation information  
3. Extract and format source references

The citation system now tracks:
- Page numbers and IDs
- Paragraph numbers and IDs
- Character positions (start and end)
- Document IDs and filenames

Research Report: Climate Change Impacts

Introduction

Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Rising global temperatures have led to unprecedented changes in weather patterns, sea levels, and ecosystem dynamics.

Methodology

Our research team analyzed temperature data from 1850 to 2023, examining trends across different geographical regions. We used statistical models to project future scenarios based on current emission trajectories.

Key Findings

The data shows a clear warming trend with the last decade recording the highest average temperatures on record. Arctic ice coverage has decreased by 40% since 1980, and sea levels have risen by 8.5 inches since 1880.

Conclusions

Immediate action is required to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Policy interventions must focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing adaptation strategies.

Economic Analysis: Renewable Energy Markets

Executive Summary

The renewable energy sector has experienced exponential growth over the past decade. Solar and wind technologies have achieved grid parity in many markets, making them cost-competitive with fossil fuels.

Market Trends

Investment in renewable energy reached $1.8 trillion globally in 2023. Solar photovoltaic installations increased by 25% year-over-year, while offshore wind capacity doubled in European markets.

Regional Analysis

Asia-Pacific leads in renewable energy deployment, accounting for 60% of global capacity additions. China alone installed 120 GW of solar capacity in 2023, surpassing all previous records.

Future Outlook

Market projections indicate that renewables will comprise 85% of new power generation capacity by 2030. Battery storage technology improvements will further accelerate adoption rates.
